# Advent of Code 2020

I'm using the HOVALAAG CPU to solve Advent of Code puzzles.  I suspect this will get too hard rather quickly.

Hovalaag is a fun programming game - see http://silverspaceship.com/hovalaag/

I've made a Verilog implementation of the Hovalaag CPU which I'm running these programs on.  See https://github.com/MichaelBell/HovalaagCPU
